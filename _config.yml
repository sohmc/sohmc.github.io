          I created this project to allow me to continue using php's mysqli libraries so I didn't have to refactor my code.  With 10+K pulls, I think it's the most popular thing I've ever created.

          This project combines many of my skills: programming, CI/CD pipelines, AWS integration, the works.  It allows home users to maintain their dynamic IP address with a subdomain that they control on Cloudflare.com.
